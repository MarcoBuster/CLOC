# Count Lines Of Code (CLOC) ![Lines of code](https://git.marcoaceti.it/MarcoBuster/CLOC)
With this little script you can **count the lines of code** in your GitHub repository and add a *little badge* in README

## How to integrate CLOC in your README
Insert this in your README, after the title:
```markdown
![Lines of code](https://git.marcoaceti.it/USERNAME/REPOSITORY)
```
Where **username** it's your GitHub username and **repository** it's your GitHub repository.

For example, for add the counter in this repository (github.com/MarcoBuster/CLOC) you must write:
```markdown
![Lines of code](https://git.marcoaceti.it/MarcoBuster/CLOC)
```
... and the result is: ![Lines of code](https://git.marcoaceti.it/MarcoBuster/CLOC)
